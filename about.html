        <p>I’m Lee Ingleton, a policy-oriented <b>Project Manager, researcher</b>, and <b>creative strategist</b> with over 20 years of experience 
          building intersectional, community-driven initiatives across Europe. My practice spans <b>inclusive research, gender justice, 
          digital rights</b>, and <b>immersive sound</b>, with a focus on participatory methods that centre marginalised voices.
          <br>
          <br>I’ve held roles as a <b>Lecturer and Researcher at the University of the Arts London</b>, and have led or co-developed projects 
          funded by <b>Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, CERV, AMIF</b> and national bodies. My academic and cultural work includes peer-reviewed publications, user manuals, 
          participatory curricula, digital archives, living labs, and online learning environments, all designed to advance equity in 
          policy, technology, and culture.
          <br><br>
          From grassroots transfeminist spaces like <a href="https://leewayprojects.github.io/projects/avelospace.html"><b>AveloSpace</b></a> 
          to pan-European platforms like <a href="https://leewayprojects.github.io/projects/eqpay4all.html"><b>EqPay4All</b></a> and my 
          current STEAM initiative <a href="https://leewayprojects.github.io/research.html"><b>Code Red</b></a>, I’ve developed an 
          ecosystem of interconnected projects spanning over two decades. These draw on my background in <b>critical sound studies (PhD)</b>, queer theory, and transfeminist 
          organising, and often bring together researchers, artists, educators, technologists, and activists in collaborative experimentation.
          <br><br>
          My work increasingly engages with <b>digital rights and public policy</b>, focusing on issues such as algorithmic discrimination, 
          online safety, and ethical AI. I contribute to the development of tools and strategies that promote inclusive access to 
          education, technology and culture, especially for marginalised groups; support LGBTQIA+ communities; and challenge hate speech and 
          polarisation through co-creation, critical pedagogy, and participatory research - work that always aligns with broader 
          movements for digital justice and bodily autonomy.          
          <br><br>
          As a queer, non-binary practitioner, I bring a lens of care, critical reflection, and intersectionality to all aspects of 
          project development, from research and writing to stakeholder engagement and digital implementation.
          <br><br>
          I am available as a consultant for projects and organisations seeking expertise in <b>inclusive research, digital rights, 
          policy</b>, and <b>creative strategy</b>. <a href="mailto:leewayprojects@proton.me">Get in touch</a> to discuss how we can collaborate for meaningful impact.
